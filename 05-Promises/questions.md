Level 1: Basic Promise Understanding
1. Create a Promise that resolves after 2 seconds

Use setTimeout

Resolve with the message: "Done!"

Log the result using .then()

2. Create a Promise that rejects

Reject it with "Something went wrong!"

Handle it with .catch()

3. Wrap a synchronous value inside a Promise

Create a promise that instantly resolves to 5

Use .then() to print double the value
